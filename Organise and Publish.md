Let‚Äôs learn more about Bear and some of its best features you can start playing with. If you need to start from the beginning, head back to Welcome to Bear or skip to the final note, Bear Pro. 

## Work Anywhere ‚òÅÔ∏è
Your notes are automatically saved as you write; that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no save button. üòÑ 

Bear uses Apple‚Äôs CloudKit for sync, available via an in-app subscription to [Bear Pro](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro). All your notes will stay in sync across Bear for iPad, iPhone, and Mac.

Bear also supports Handoff between your iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This lets you start a note on one device and *instantly* switch

## Publish Everywhere
The *info panel*, reachable via the ‚ìò icon in the Editor, has all your export options for when it‚Äôs time to send your notes and prose elsewhere (available with an in-app Bear Pro subscription). You can export to PDF, HTML, Word (DOCX), and even create images of your writing, which are handy for posting on social media and other places that have limited character counts.

## The Details
Also in that information panel about each note in . There you can find *word count tools* including characters, paragraphs, and an estimated *read time*.

## Tags and Sub-Tags
One of Bear‚Äôs most powerful features is *tags*. When you add a word with a pound sign like this #welcome, Bear treats that as a sort of folder or category for collecting all notes with that same tag. It's a great way to group multiple notes of ideas, for a project, by topic, or in any way you can imagine.

You can add as many tags as you want to each note, and they‚Äôre created on the fly. Just use a word with a pound sign, and Bear takes care of the rest. All tags appear in the Sidebar, the left-most panel of Bear‚Äôs window. See Welcome to Bear to learn more about Bear‚Äôs layout and other core features.

### But wait, there‚Äôs more! 
Bear can also group related tags together as sub-tags. For example: say you add a note with the tag #welcome/organize . The /organize/ tag in the Sidebar will become a sub-tag of /welcome/!

Sub-tags work like folders in the sidebar. Tap or click the close/open button next to them, and you'll see their related sub-tags. This gives you even more organisational power with tags in Bear, and we encourage you to give them a try for your workflow.

Finally, Bear supports *multi-word tags* for example: #welcome/tags multiword# Just surround the words with a pound sign on either end.
